# Classic-Skin-Improves-for-Winamp-Lite
This plugin contains two small adds to improve the classic Winamp look, definitely for those who really love the classic look.

This is what is included:

* "Classic Skins Opacity" It was created to provide window opacity support for Winamp Classic Skins. (By I. Epaminonda, D. Owen & edited by D. Estrada)
* "Concept Classic Skin" A minimalist skin, redesign of the original classic skin. (By D. Toledo update by D. Estrada)
